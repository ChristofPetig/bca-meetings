# Component Model Implementation Meetings

The Bytecode Alliance hosts weekly meetings as status updates and discussion on
the implementation of the component model in the ecosystem and in Wasmtime.
Anyone interested in this is welcome to join.

## Time and location

**When**: every other Wednesday at 9am PST
**Where**: Zoom (link in calendar invite)

## Attending

To attend, please email <alex.crichton@fermyon.com>, or reach out [on
Zulip](https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/217126-wasmtime).

## Agendas and notes

Each meeting has an [agenda available
online](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/meetings/tree/main/component-model)
which will be discussed during the meeting. If you have something you'd like to
discuss or a question asked please file a PR against the agenda of the meeting
you'd like to attend. If no items are on the agenda on the day of the meeting
the meeting will be cancelled. Notes are not taken at this time.

This meeting is intended to be informational and used for coordination around
efforts on projects such as:

* Wasmtime's component model implementation.
* The `wit-bindgen` repository and language bindings.
* Tooling such as `cargo component` and integration into language ecosystems.

For now this is intended to be a "light weight" meeting in the sense that those
who are interested can join and can feel free to drop out or not come at all if
they're otherwise busy. It's unlikely that this meeting will take the full hour
each instance.
