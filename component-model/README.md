# Component Model Implementation Meetings

The Bytecode Alliance hosts weekly meetings as status updates on the
implementation of the component model in the ecosystem and in Wasmtime. Anyone
interested in this is welcome to join.

## Time and location

**When**: every other Wednesday at 9am PST
**Where**: Zoom (link in calendar invite)

## Attending

To attend, please email <alex.crichton@fermyon.com>, or reach out [on Zulip](https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/217126-wasmtime).

## Agendas and notes

Unlike other meetings the Bytecode Alliance hosts this meeting does not have a
prior agenda and does not retain notes at this time. It's intended to be
informational and used for coordination around efforts on projects such as:

* Wasmtime's component model implementation.
* The `wit-bindgen` repository and language bindings.
* Tooling such as `cargo component` and integration into language ecosystems.

For now this is intended to be a "light weight" meeting in the sense that those
who are interested can join and can feel free to drop out or not come at all if
they're otherwise busy. It's unlikely that this meeting will take the full hour
each week.
