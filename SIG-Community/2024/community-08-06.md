## Notes

* [Divya] action item from previous meeting — created a form to source content from the community for the community stream - any feedback?
	* [Bailey] Are we using this as a way to broadcast that we have a community stream? Could be a good opportunity. It’s been a long time since we’ve emailed the ByteCode Alliance.
	* [Karen] Is there a mailing list? 
	* [Bailey] There’s a Google Group of recognized contributors; Bailey to check if she’s allowed to do that
	* [Divya] Mailing list is a great idea but do we have a mailing list people can subscribe to just for the community stream? There’s something on Zulip but if we can get a mailing list + calendar for Google, it would make it easy to send out calendar invites. People tend to forget because they don’t have any notifications. 
	* [Bailey] It’s on the events.bytecodealliance calendar; would be a good one to use or we could potentially create another one; we haven’t emailed people so not sure about the rules for setting it up
	* [Divya] Can we federate it into a mailing group? We could attach events to mailing groups so you don’t even need to send cal invites.
	* [Karen] Can you clarify? Do you mean when you subscribe to a mailing group and that subscribes you to the calendar so that it just shows up for them without having to subscribe to the calendar?
	* [Divya] Yes; if I want to add something a calendar as an admin (of K8s SIG-Docs), I can create a calendar event and it get sent to everyone in the mailing group. 
	* [Karen] If it’s monthly, I think it’s okay. If it’s every week, it may be perceived as spammy.
	* [Bailey] People may be annoyed if they get unsolicited emails.
	* [Karen] As they sign up for the mailing list, isn’t that consent?
	* [Divya] Got an email after joining recognized contributor email group and it said that comms would be for stuff like this. Let’s just be explicit about what content they may be getting.
	* [Bailey] We have the recognized contributors mailing list - do we want to do a separate one for events?
	* [Divya] Would be helpful to keep events separate from recognized contributors so people aren’t spammed with every event that has ever happened.
	* [Bailey] So do we want to ask David to create a community.bytecodealliance Google group? 
	* [Divya] Do we want to consider having recognized contributors in the group at the beginning or have this be a public Google group?
	* [Bailey] Would like a public Google Group people can subscribe to, but this is a paid SaaS feature.
	* [Karen] Aren’t google mailing lists free? Or do you mean if it’s with the Bytecode Alliance domain?
	* [Divya] Lots of K8s mailing list use @googlegroup.com
	* [Karen] If it’s a net-new mailing list via google groups, we will need the recognized contributors to opt-in right? Because it’ll be a new mailing list and we won't have gotten permission from them.
	* [Divya] We should open it up to the public and not just recognized contributors 
	* [Bailey] The goal is to get most people involved so it sounds like we want a community BA mailing list (can ask David to make one under bytecodealliance.org or use googlegroups). Then anyone can add themselves to it.
	* [Karen] Which is the preference between the two?
	* [Bailey] would prefer it under the Bytecode Alliance domain so there’s proper governance; fall back would be creating it through google groups with the TOC + David as admins


## Action Items

* [Karen] Ask David via Zulip SIG-community channel about creating the mailing list
