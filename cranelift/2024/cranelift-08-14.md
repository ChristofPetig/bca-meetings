  - presented 128-bit ops to CG; now phase 1; some skepticism and desire from
    CG members to continue to discuss flags-based option as well
- abrown:
  - shared-everything threads
  - hardware-specialized Wasm: idea to swap out machine code for small snippets
    of Wasm for performance reasons

  - no updates
- fitzgen:
  - got PR for Pulley backend up
- cfallin:
  - update from GSoC project (Demilade Sonuga's fastalloc RA2 algorithm):

    good compile-time speedup numbers, more to come.
