<p style="padding-left:1em; padding-right:0.5em; padding-bottom:1em">First, welcome to SIG Embedded. The Embedded SIG's charter calls for a rolling set of meetings which will occur in three major time zones; the Asia Pacific, Europe and finally the Americas. To make this happen we need to decide on a meeting cadence and to search for and nominate co-chairs, with at least one co-chair per time-zone. There will be communication on our <a href="https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/438936-SIG-Embedded">Zulip channel</a> as we schedule this meeting. Please reach out there for the initial inaugural meeting invite, and please also keep an eye on the <a href="./2024/">2024 folder</a> as the meeting times are announced.</p>
