# June {TBD} Inaugural SIG-Embedded Meeting

**See the [instructions](../README.md) for details on how to attend**

**NB:** The SIG-Embedded Charter calls for meetings to occur on a rotating basis in three time zones. This inaugural meeting will be held to decide upon the co-chairs and meeting schedule the SIG will follow.

## Agenda

1. Opening, welcome and roll call
1. Decide upon policy for recording meetings, if acceptable then record the remainder of the meeting. 
1. Select note takes for the meeting
1. **Inaugural Item 1 :** Call for nominations & votes for co-chairs
    The embedded SIG's charter calls for 3 co-chairs, one for each of the time zones in which we expect to hold meetings.
1. **Inaugural Item 2 :** Select meeting frequency and time zone schedule for future meetings.
    There are some restrictions on the times available as the meeting schedule should avoid clashing with the Core WebAssembly Working Group, and the WASI Sub Group.
