## Agenda

1. Opening, welcome and roll call

2. Announce that the meeting will be recorded and hit record as agreed upon in inaugural meeting. 

3. Announcements
   
   1. **Requests for clarification: Devices without an MCU / MMU** </br>
      It is proposed that we declare that for the embedded-sig we will not address hardware which does not have some form of memory control either in the form of an MMU or an MCU.  
      **Background**  
      Based on the hardware platforms we selected, I couldn’t find devices which had the required amount of memory, but didn’t come with at least some form of memory protection.  
      Request for Hardware Requirements Clarification:  [https://github.com/bytecodealliance/sig-embedded/issues/7](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/sig-embedded/issues/7)
   2. **Proposed Approaches to Shared Memory**  
      There are requests for feedback, requirements and scenarios for using shared memory on embedded systems. Not just from the WASI SDK folks, but also from the Core-WASM folks. An initial set of approaches was outlined here - Memory Sharing Discussion - [https://github.com/WebAssembly/memory-control/issues/19](https://github.com/WebAssembly/memory-control/issues/19). This should be expanded to include some use cases and we should attempt to recommend a possible approach.
