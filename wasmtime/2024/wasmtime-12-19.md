   1. (@dicej) Discuss CI testing strategy.  Currently, many tests run with all features enabled rather than just the default features, meaning what we're testing isn't necessarily what users are using.  The upcoming [component-model-async](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9582) feature will enable code paths which differ considerably from the default build, so we should discuss the implications of that.
