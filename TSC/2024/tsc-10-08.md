### Agenda
The TSC reviewed the agenda for the meeting and a final agenda was agreed upon.

### Topic #1
The TSC reviewed current governance topics as identified across issues and pull requests in the Alliance governance and project repositories, consideration of projects for Hosted or Core Project status, Special Interest Group activities, and ongoing standards activities within the W3C Community Group. Proper follow-up actions will be taken by reviewers on the requests discussed. Discussion continued regarding ongoing review of core project requirements with representatives of the WAMR team, most recently based on the team's written summary of status on a per-requirement basis.
